# Welcome to the Azure Data environment with Azure Synapse, Azure OpenAI and Model Context Protocol! 🚀🤖

Version 0.3.0

Hi there, Developer! This project is a minimal implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client that leverages Azure OpenAI for the Large Language Model. It is designed to demonstrate how to integrate MCP with Azure OpenAI in a lightweight and efficient manner.

We can't wait to see what you create with this MCP client! Happy coding!
